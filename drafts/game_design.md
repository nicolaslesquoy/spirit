# Game Design Document (GDD)

This document outlines the *design and development plan* for a game for which the prototype game engine is being created. It serves as a guide for the features, mechanics, and overall vision of the game.

This document is based on resources found in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/7ze7xq/finished_game_design_document_examples/).

## Game Overview

- **Working Title**: "Spirit"
- **Final Title**: *TBD*
- **Genre**: Action-Adventure-Exploration
- **Platform**: PC (Windows, Linux only for now, priority on Linux)

"Spirit" is an action-adventure game with a heavy focus on exploration. The player will have to flee from a large alien facility, while facing various challenges and enemies controlled by a powerful and ancient AI. Each time the player dies, they will restart at where they first spawned, but the AI will adapt to the player's actions, making each playthrough unique and harder.
