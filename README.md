# Game Engine Prototype

This is a prototype for a fully featured 3 game engine written in C/C++/Fortran. It is intended for my personal use and educational purposes. There isn't much going on for now, but feel free to contribute later when the project is more fleshed out. A contribution guide will be provided in the future.
